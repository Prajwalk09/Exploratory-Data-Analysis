# Automated EDA using DataPrep, Sweetviz, Pandas-Profiling and D-Tale

This repository contains an example of how to perform automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) using three Python libraries: DataPrep, Sweetviz, Pandas-Profiling and D-Tale. 

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to use DataPrep, Sweetviz, and D-Tale to perform automated EDA on a dataset. Each library offers unique features that can be used to quickly gain insights into a dataset without having to write a lot of code.

The "tips" dataset is a popular dataset provided by Seaborn and is used for data analysis and visualization. It contains information about the tips given by customers in a restaurant, as well as other information such as the total bill, the gender of the customer, and whether they were a smoker or not. The dataset is often used to explore relationships between variables and to develop predictive models. It is included in the seaborn library in Python and is often used as a sample dataset for practicing data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

- DataPrep
- Sweetviz
- D-Tale
- Pandas-Profiling

You can install these libraries using pip:<br>
```python
pip install dataprep sweetviz dtale pandas_profiling
```


This script will use the in-built 'Tips' dataset provided by Seaborn and uses D-Tale, DataPrep and Sweetviz to perform EDA on the dataset.

The generated report and dashboard will be saved in the same directory.

## Example Output

The following files will be generated in the same directory:

- `SweetvizReport.html`: This is a report generated by Sweetviz that provides an overview of the dataset, including distributions, correlations, and missing values.
- `DataprepReport.html`: The report generated by DataPrep provides a summary of the dataset's structure, including the number of columns and rows, as well as a preview of the dataset's contents. It also identifies missing values, duplicated rows, and data types for each column.
- `PandasProfilingReport.html`: Pandas profiling generates a detailed report that provides statistical analysis and visualizations of the data. It includes information such as data types, missing values, correlation between variables, distributions, and outliers.
